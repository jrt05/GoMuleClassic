# GoMuleClassic
GoMuleClassic is a fork of GoMule. The purpose of this fork is to add support for D2R classic. Since we don't have a shared stash, GoMule is extra important.

99.9% of this code was unchanged. I did about 0.1% modification to add support for classic. So big thanks to the GoMule team for all their hard work.

Things I changed.

1. Disabled saving Merc items. This should have fixed all corruption issues.
2. Changed stash graphics and code to match stash size.
3. Disabled loading LoD characters.
4. Disabled adding items to mercs.
5. Disabled weapon swap.

It's possible there are more issues, but I really don't think so. Things have been going smoothly.
