# GoMuleClassic
GoMuleClassic is a fork of GoMule. The purpose of this fork is to add support for D2R classic. Since we don't have a shared stash, GoMule is extra important.

99.9% of this code was unchanged. I literally did 0.1 percent modification to add support for classic. So big thanks to the GoMule team for all their hard work.
